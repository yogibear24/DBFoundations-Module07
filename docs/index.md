## Introduction
In this paper I will explain when to use a SQL User Defined Function (UDF). 
I will also go over the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.

## When to Use a SQL User Defined Function (UDF)
We can use a SQL UDF when a couple of single Built-In SQL Functions do not meet the needs of the user, 
such as in a View. In addition, we can use a SQL UDF when we would like to return a View but with 
certain parameters, since Functions can accept argument parameters unlike Views. 
SQL UDFs can return a table of values or a single value. UDFs that return a single value as an 
expression are called Scalar Functions. See Figure 1 below for an example of a User Defined Function




## The Differences Between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions
The differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions are in what they return. 
Scalar Functions return a single value, Inline Functions return a single statement table, 
while Multi-Statement Functions return a table using multiple statements.

## Summary
I have learned a lot about SQL Built-In Functions and UDFs in this module, 
such as with the situations in when to use a SQL UDF, as well as the differences between 
Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions, and we have specifically discussed in-detail about 
most of these topics in this writeup.
